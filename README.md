### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page. I'm a Power Platform Developer with prior experience with the following technologies:

- Power Apps
- Power Automate
- Power BI
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- SQL
- T-SQL
- C++

Sadly, I never had formal training on programming and learned from the school of hard knocks through various projects throughout my career. These days, I gain most of my development experience working in Power Platform in the GCC[^1]: environment. This means I don't get to play with the new shiny toys, but instead have to figure out how to create the shiny toys using older technologies for my clients.

[^1]: GCC: Government Community Cloud
