### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page. I'm a Power Platform Developer with prior experience with the following technologies:

- Power Apps [^1]
- Power Automate [^1]
- Power BI [^1]
- Azure Active Directory [^1]
- Azure B2B Identity Governance [^1]
- OpenAPI [^1]
- REST [^1]
- HTML [^1]
- CSS [^1]
- Javascript [^2] and JSON [^1]
- JQuery [^2]
- VBA [^2]
- SQL [^2]
- T-SQL [^2]
- C++ [^3]
- Git [^3]

Sadly, I never had formal training on programming and learned from the school of hard knocks through various projects throughout my career. These days, I gain most of my development experience working in Power Platform in the GCC[^4]: environment. This means I don't get to play with the new shiny toys, but instead have to figure out how to create the shiny toys using older technologies for my clients.

[^1]: Actively using
[^2]: Previously used in work projects
[^3]: Learned in college, gave me a great foundation
[^4]: GCC: Government Community Cloud
